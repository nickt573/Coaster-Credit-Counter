search.py from my Coaster-Credit-Counter repository is my simplified, command-line expression of my more robust, user-friendly webpage "Triple C"â€”a site designed by rollercoaster enthusiasts for rollercoaster enthusiasts to keep track of the amount of rollercoasters they have been on.  More information on how to access and use Triple C can be found below.  Neither search.py nor Triple C serve as a database, and all information belongs exclusively to RCDB.com.  

There are a handful of optimizations in search.py and on Triple C to ensure desired results are produced; however, the fixes are not all-encompassing.  When executed, search.py prompts the user for a ride and park name, and at least one must be specified.  Any relevant information about the specified rollercoaster(s) will then be reported.  Beyond this, the Triple C website has the exclusive ability to save rollercoasters and view the pages of other users.
